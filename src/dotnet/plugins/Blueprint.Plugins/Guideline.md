# Guidelines for Vertical Slicing Architecture and SOLID Principles

This document explains how the `Blueprint.Plugins` project adheres to the principles of vertical slicing architecture and SOLID design principles.

## Vertical Slicing Architecture

Vertical slicing is an architectural approach that organizes code by features rather than technical layers. This approach ensures that each feature is self-contained and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### How This Project Implements Vertical Slicing

1. **Feature-Based Organization**:
   - The `Features/` directory contains subdirectories for each feature, such as `CustomersManagement`.
   - Each feature directory includes all the necessary components, such as plugins, business rules, and supporting classes.

2. **Self-Contained Features**:
   - For example, the `CustomersManagement` feature includes:
     - `BoundCustomApiSamplePlugin.cs`: A plugin specific to the feature.
     - `BusinessRules/EnsureContactEmailAddressIsNotEmptyBusinessRule.cs`: A business rule that enforces feature-specific logic.

3. **Independent Development**:
   - Each feature can be developed and tested independently, reducing dependencies and improving maintainability.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that promote maintainable and scalable software. Here’s how this project adheres to these principles:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Each class has a single responsibility. For example:
     - `BoundCustomApiSamplePlugin.cs` is responsible for handling a specific custom API.
     - `SampleBusinessRule.cs` encapsulates a single business rule.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. For example:
     - New business rules can be added without modifying existing ones by implementing the `IBusinessRule` interface.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes. For example:
     - Plugins inherit from `PluginBase`, ensuring consistent behavior while allowing customization.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Interfaces are designed to be specific to the needs of their clients. For example:
     - The `IBusinessRule` interface defines a minimal contract for business rules, ensuring simplicity and focus.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions. For example:
     - The `CachedEnvironmentVariableService` and `CrmEnvironmentVariableService` implement the `ICustomEnvironmentVariableService` interface, allowing the plugin to depend on the abstraction rather than the implementation.
   - The `ILocalPluginContext` holds the dependencies required by the plugin and lazy-loads their implementations whenever they are called. This ensures that resources are only initialized when needed, improving performance and reducing unnecessary overhead.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Scalability**: Features can be added or modified without impacting other parts of the system.
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand and maintain due to clear separation of concerns.
- **Testability**: Each feature and component can be tested in isolation, improving test coverage and reliability.
- **Team Collaboration**: Teams can work on different features simultaneously without stepping on each other’s toes.

By adhering to vertical slicing architecture and SOLID principles, the `Blueprint.Plugins` project ensures a robust, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
